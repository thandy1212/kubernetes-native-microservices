# account-service Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/account-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.

## Deploying to minikube locally
To deploy `accounts-service` to a local instance of minikube run the following:
```shell script
minikube start 
eval $(minikube docker-env) # configures your current session with appropriate 
                            # docker environment variables
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true
```
## Running in minikube on MacOs
To run locally on MacOs through minikube you'll need to add 
```
127.0.0.1 hello-world.info
```
to `/etc/hosts`. Once the service, deployment, and ingress are created you'll need to start a 
```shell script
minikube tunnel
```
in a new terminal. You should then be able to access the endpoints at `hello-world.info/accounts`
